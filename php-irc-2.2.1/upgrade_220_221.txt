There are some things that have changed:

1) Please go through your bot.conf file and add your options to the new 2.2.1 bot conf file because there 
   are several new options

2) You should be able to just copy your typedefs.conf and function.conf and modules over and they should work with 
   no modification.  NOTE:  If you just copy over your old module directory and overwrite the new module directory,
   make sure that you retain the new "default" directory, as it contains the admin dcc chat interface stuff

3) Have fun?  Enjoy?  I guess?
