# Commands #

The following is a list of commands that users in IRC can say to the IRC bot. The **names** of these commands are configurable in the Settings screen on the Dashboard; the default names are used here.

## Admin Commands ##

In order to use these admin commands, you must:

* Be authenticated with NickServ
* Be listed in "IRC &rarr; List of users who can give admin commands" in the Settings screen

``!set key1 value1; key2 value2; ...``

:   Set options. After "!set", give a list of which values you want to set to which [keys](?page=musicstreamvote&help=option_names), separated by semicolons. (If you need to put a semicolon into a value, escape it with "\\"; escape a "\\" as "\\\\".)

    For options that are can be true or false, specify them as "1" or "0".

    Example: ``!set irc_channels #newchannel; irc_msg_type privmsg``

## User Commands ##

These can be used by anyone in the IRC chat room. You can configure the response for each command in the "Responses" of the "Settings" Dashboard page.

``(say hi)``

:   Special command that is triggered by starting an IRC message with the bot's nick.
