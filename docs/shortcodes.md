# Shortcodes #

The following shortcodes are supported in WordPress Pages and Posts:

* [now_playing] -- Shows currently playing "stream title" (artist and track) and nothing more. Updates every 10 seconds. You may want to use this inside a Text Widget in your sidebar using [this plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/use-shortcodes-in-sidebar-widgets/).
* [recent_tracks] -- Shows current track and most recent 5 before that. Updates every 10 seconds.
* [last_day] -- Shows last 24 hours of tracks played.
* [top_hundred] -- Shows top 100 tracks by vote total.

*A future release of Music Stream Vote will provide parameters for these short codes and probably a query form for the web site viewer.*
